## Why, tho?

I want to make too many things and needed to limit the financial impact of this experiment.

Along the way, I'd like to pick up some novice abilities in CAD, garage CNC, and additive manufacturing.

## Limited budget? What's your BOM?
* Gist: < $250/worktop

## Can I use this?
Add an issue on this repo and I'll add a non-commercial license. I've a brain bug about making one of these manufacture itself end-to-end and I want to pursue that for a bit.

That said, this work has a route to your usage which doesn't involve me.

## Public domain, eh?
Yes - if I've abandoned the work, I'll release it to the public domain.
